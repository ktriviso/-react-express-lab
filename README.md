# React Quotes App

This repo contains an Express app that has JSON endpoints for performing CRUD on our quotes table from last unit.

Todays lab will to be to add a React front-end to our quotes API.

## Serving the React App from Express

We want to configure our app so that we can actively develop both the Express and React Apps and get quick feedback.

We also want to make considerations for when we deploy to a production environment.

## Consuming the Quotes API from the Express Apps

1. Display all the quotes
2. Add form to create quotes
3. Add a button to delete a quote

BONUS:

4. Add an edit button that will show a form for editing a particular quote. Persist the edits.
